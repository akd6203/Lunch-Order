# LunchOrder Project

The LunchOrder project is a program that allows customers to place orders for coffee and pizza using their accounts. The program provides functionality to create orders, make payments using the customer's wallet, and transfer funds between accounts.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following classes:

1. Account: Represents a customer account and provides methods for managing the account balance.
2. Pizza: Represents a pizza order with size and toppings information.
3. Coffee: Represents a coffee order with size, type, quantity, milk type, and flavor information.
4. LunchOrder: Contains the main entry point for the program and includes test code for simulating different situations.

## How to Run the Program

To run the LunchOrder program, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Clone the project repository or download the source code files.
3. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. Compile the Java files by running the following command:

   ```shell
   javac *.java
   ```

5. Once the compilation is successful, run the program with the following command:

   ```shell
   java LunchOrder
   ```

6. The program will simulate various situations, including placing lunch orders, depositing money to customer accounts, and transferring funds.

## Testing

The LunchOrder program has been tested for the following scenarios:

1. Placing lunch orders: Multiple coffee and pizza orders are created and processed.
2. Depositing money and paying for a lunch: Funds are deposited into a customer's account, and the payment is made using the account balance.
3. Transferring money to another account: Funds are transferred from one account to another.

During testing, the program was verified for correctness and adherence to the problem requirements.

## Additional Notes

- The program uses a simple console-based interface for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, a graphical user interface (GUI) or web-based interface would be implemented for a better user experience.
- The project adheres to the principles of object-oriented programming, encapsulating data and behavior within appropriate classes and using proper class relationships.
- The code includes comments to provide clarity and understanding of the program logic.
